  "description": "Semantic-Forge is an innovative desktop browser built with Electron that transforms the web into a personalized experience. Inspired by the vision of AI as a dynamic renderer rather than just an assistant, it reinterprets web pages in real-time to match your preferred UI grammar. No more relearning every site's \"dialect\" of buttons, navs, and layoutsâ€”Semantic-Forge uses AI to reflow content into familiar designs, letting you truly own your browsing.",
